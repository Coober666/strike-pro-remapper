# Alesis Strike `.skt` / `.sin` File Format Reference

Community reverse-engineering reference for the Alesis Strike / Strike Pro module's kit
(`.skt`) and instrument (`.sin`) file formats. Maintained as part of
[Strike Pro Remapper](README.md); verified against the module's 116 factory preset kits and
1,749 factory instruments via byte-for-byte round-trip tests.

**Confidence legend:**
- ✅ **confirmed** — verified by hardware hex diff (change value on module → compare bytes)
- 📊 **strong evidence** — statistical analysis across all factory presets matches the
  documented parameter range exactly
- ⚠️ **hypothesis** — structurally plausible, byte patterns consistent, not yet verified
- ❓ **unknown** — bytes exist, purpose unidentified

Multi-byte integers are **little-endian**. Files are **4-byte aligned** (zero-padded).
Signed bytes use two's complement (`0xCE` = −50).

---

## Common chunk structure

Both formats are sequences of chunks:

```
+0  4 bytes   ASCII magic ('KIT ', 'inst', 'str ', 'INST', 'msmp')
+4  uint32    payload size
+8  payload
```

---

## `.skt` — Kit file

Chunk sequence: one `KIT ` block, ~22 `inst` blocks (one per pad/zone), one `str ` block,
then zero padding.

### `KIT ` block — kit-level settings (44-byte payload)

Offsets below are **kit_raw-relative** (payload offset + 8-byte chunk header), matching
the project's source. Layout ✅ hardware-confirmed via hex diff against official-editor
saves (May 2026):

| 50 | uint8 | HF freq index (77=8.7 kHz, 78=9.1 kHz; sequential) | ✅ |

**FX type enum** — 0-based, no Off entry (0xFF = off). Anchored by hex diff
(0=Mono Flanger, 1=Stereo Flanger, 3=Mono Chorus 1); remainder inferred from the
manuals' effects-table order:

```
0 Mono Flanger   1 Stereo Flanger  2 Xover Flanger   3 Mono Chorus 1
4 Mono Chorus 2  5 Stereo Chorus   6 XOver Chorus    7 Mono Vibrato
8 Vibrato        9 Mono Doubler   10 Doubler        11 Mono Slapback
12 Slapback     13 Mono Delay     14 Delay          15 XOver Delay
16 Ping Pong                       (0xFF = off)
```

### `inst` block — one per pad/zone (72-byte payload)

The first 4 bytes are the zone ID in ASCII (e.g. `K1H `, `S1R `, `C2B `: kick/snare/tom/
hihat/crash/ride + number + Head/Rim/Bow/Edge/Foot/D=bell). Layer A occupies offsets
4–23; layer B is an exact structural mirror at +20 (offsets 24–43).

All visible per-pad parameters in the official editor are now ✅ **hardware-confirmed**
(hex diff against official-editor saves, May 2026):

### `str ` block

Zero-terminated ASCII strings, one per instrument slot, referenced by index from the
`inst` blocks. Paths are relative with forward slashes (e.g. `Kicks/Big Boom.sin`).

---

## `.sin` — Instrument file

Chunk sequence: `INST` (24-byte params) → `msmp` (sample mappings) → `str ` (WAV paths).
INST layout originally decoded by [strike4j](https://github.com/cbuschka/strike4j);
verified here against all 1,749 factory instruments with zero exceptions.

### `INST` block (24-byte payload)

| 0 | uint8 | constant 0 | — |
| 1 | uint8 | instrument group 0–19 (see group enum) | 📊 |

**Instrument group enum** (byte 1; names verified empirically by correlating against the
factory library's folder structure — groups 6/12/15/16/17 unused by the factory set):

```
0 Kick      1 Snare        2 Tom         3 Hi-Hat       4 Crash    5 Ride
7 E. Kick   8 E. Snare     9 E. Tom     10 Percussion  11 Perc Ethnic
13 Perc Orchestral  14 E. Perc  18 Claps/SFX  19 Melodic
```

### `msmp` block — sample mappings

Header (4 bytes): `[0]` cycle mode (0 = round-robin, 1 = random), `[1]` ❓, `[2]` mapping
count, `[3]` ❓. Then `count` × 28-byte mapping records:

| Offset | Type | Meaning | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0–1 | uint16 | string index into `str ` table (the WAV path) | 📊 |
| 2 | uint8 | command byte (0x63 typical; 0x4D–0x62 observed in presets) | ❓ |
| 3 | uint8 | velocity range min 0–127 | 📊 |
| 4 | uint8 | velocity range max 0–127 | 📊 |
| 5–6 | bytes | ❓ (6 mostly 0x7F) | ❓ |
| 7 | int8 | round-robin index (1-based within a velocity band); **signed** — `0xFE`/−2 marks hi-hat pedal chick/splash functions | 📊 |
| 8–9 | bytes | ❓ | ❓ |
| 10 | uint8 | hi-hat pedal-open range min 0–127 | ⚠️ (per strike4j) |
| 11 | uint8 | hi-hat pedal-open range max 0–127 | ⚠️ (per strike4j) |
| 12–27 | bytes | ❓ (constants/sparse; preserve on edit) | ❓ |

### `str ` block

Zero-terminated ASCII WAV paths. Preset instruments use paths relative to
`<SD volume>/Samples/`; locally-created instruments may use paths relative to the
instrument library root. **Paths are effectively absolute references — renaming or moving
a WAV breaks every instrument that points at it.**

---

## Practical notes for implementers

- **Round-trip before writing.** Parse → rebuild must reproduce input files byte-for-byte
  before you trust any writer (`tools/test_roundtrip.py`, `tools/test_sin_roundtrip.py`).
- **Never invent unknown bytes.** When adding mapping records, clone an existing record
  from the same file and patch only the known fields.
- **Module constraints:** filenames ≤ 26 chars; instruments must live in a subfolder of
  `/Instruments/` (never the root); one subfolder level visible; 200 MB per kit;
  WAVs 16/24-bit, 44.1/48/96 kHz (48 kHz native).
- **Factory pad defaults:** offsets 53/54 are `102`/`1` in every factory pad. Generated
  kits that write zeros there load fine but may differ in MIDI gate/note-off behavior.
